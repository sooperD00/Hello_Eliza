# Hello_Eliza


# FAQ
- I design systems where humans interact with complex things and don't notice the complexity
- I build systems that make people curious
- Nobody needs you to pick one. The people worth working for will see that the person who built intermittent reinforcement into a nav bar is the same person who kept production systems running for a decade — and that's not a contradiction, it's a superpower.


## Notes
- Zork state lives in sessionStorage (clears on tab close)
- Unlocked links persist per session, appear in bottom-left
- The rules JSON is the heart — that's where the personality lives
- Blog essays are just .md files, no database needed

# Tune the Rules (ongoing) 2/4/2026
Edit `wwwroot/data/zork-rules.json` to:
- Add more patterns
- Adjust responses
- Change idle timing
- Add Crawford-specific easter eggs
No recompile needed — it's just JSON.

# View it, Furball
- [ ] cd Hello_Eliza/Hello_Eliza/
- [ ] dotnet run
- [ ] http://localhost:5103

---

# Next Time You Come By 2/??/2026
- [ ] Make something special for Crawford... more rules?

- [ ] essay stylings
- [ ] commit

# Hardening
- [ ] something that runs and checks if my links still work...

# Documentation
- [ ] update README.md for the new color scheme

# Teaching
- [ ] add in those cool @zork comments so you can show parts of the text

# Conversation
- [ ] change redirect to providing a link instead in the "conversation" area
- [ ] Add fade-out before fade-in on output change (helps distracted users notice)
- [ ] you need a better transition for turn enum #3...
- [ ] ASCII output is a little thin/small
- [ ] at least 3 "deep paths"?
- [ ] add a lot/bunch more questions and what happens when user says "yes/no"
- [ ] do something with $input like when you were 12

# Glitching
- [x] add a discoverable "terminal" link at the top
- [x] like home but terminal - that gives you a nice open spot for ppl to keep guessing and an unlikely word for it ;)
- [ ] Add a subtle idle animation — the | pipes blink like a cursor every few seconds
- [ ] Make it a zork trigger: typing "source" or "github" opens the repo
- [ ] make a glitch effect on pipe chars and open link spots
- [ ] make "snowcrash" animation/blinking in the other spots
- [ ] Randomize the footer occasionally and subtly in an animation on a timer

Undiscovered slots: invisible but space-reserved 
(▓░░ saved for future ambient glitch system)
Discovery: slow fade-in → 2 glitches (jitter + cyan/magenta) → settle as solid link
No navigation on first discovery — the animation IS the reward. Second time they type it → navigates.
External links still open in new tab as-is


# Pages
- [x] privacy stylings
- [x] FAQ page "question|frequently|why"
- [ ] FAQ content .md

# Mystery
- [x] make the "essays" and other link fade in
- [x] make them fade in *in their spot* so it will have open spots that suggest there are more
- [ ] make a random button for the essays in between <- prev and next ->
- [ ] the random button should be named something fun

# Essays cleanup 2/6/2026
- [x] styles
- [x] /essays/{slug} needs a next -> button and a -> random button

# Footer 2/5/2026

- [x] soften the footer font color?
- [x] remove neuromancer from footer - keep in privacy
- [-] put privacy [ privacy ] simple link in footer
- [x] randomize the footer

# Nav Menu 2/5/2026

- [x] fix discovered links section (remove zork-unlock version)
- [x] move bonus appearing secret links to top
- [x] internal links only
- [x] add /cave coming soon
	- [x] you didn't get that brick look you were going for - it's ok, put it here
# Conversation Turns Business Logic Fixes 2/5/2026
- [x] conversation turns are not working as expected - you need to escape //? in regex
- [x] tune the rules - they're kinda stoopid rn

# Terminal Design Cleanup 2/5/2026
- [x] make it so user can just start typing and not have to click the input
- [x] prompt, input, go all on 1 line
- [x] disable text refill suggestions - it kills the mood
- [x] the footer keeps moving up and down depending on the text - keep it lower


# Test 2/4/2026
- [x] dotnet run
1. Go to homepage → type something → ASCII art
2. Type again → ASCII art
3. Type third time → "Do you like my art?" (serif!)
4. Type "yes" → conversation begins
5. Type "blog" → redirects to /essays
6. Check /essays shows your sample essay
7. Click essay → detail view works


# CSS 2/4/2026
- [x] new :root{} with zork box / 70's paperback / literary palatte
- [x] nuke boilerplate _Layout.cshtml.css
- [x] nuke zork.css
- [x] conversation/ASCII output below the new 'terminal'
- [x] Add js timer back in
- [x] Add fade-out before fade-in on output change (helps distracted users notice)
