*Alexa, lights on.* What does it mean to write a personal essay? What does it mean to be thanked for clear and didactic prose? What does it mean that even here I am unable to own my identity? Why is the moon white, will my kids survive, and why does my mom in law think I should write about how I grow my own very tiny carrots? What am I going to be when I grow up and what does it mean to write code in the age of AI?

*Alexa, lights 10%.* The moon is not white. It is black. It is made of anorthositic plagioclase feldspar and basalt, which are grey and black, respectively. It looks white because of the contrast with even blacker space. Even in the daytime, when space looks blue because of the water molecules in our atmosphere Rayleigh scattering, the moon is still not white. 

*Alexa, lights white.* I hope my kids survive. One sheet of paper costs 10 litres of water. Topsoil erodes at an average of 1.9 mm every year in the U.S. Midwest. Soluble nitrates cause cancer at < 10 mg/L, birth control should be free, and education should be oxygen. Every hair on their head is counted. 

*Alexa, lights bright white.* I like pie. I like the Bach Partitas. I like cold Januaries, warm showers, and hot reloads when you're playing with the css. Streptomyces antinomyctes is the best smell, *Empire* is the best Star Wars, I got a B-, and vi > Emacs. Books are alive and God is dead and Holden Caulfield is the biggest phoney of them all. 

*Alexa, lights off.* Why is the moon white? Why do n odd numbers add to n^2? Why am I doing *this* with my one wild and precious life? Because something told me, "Ship something. You'll feel better. 🚀 " So here I am, announcing my place in the family of things.
