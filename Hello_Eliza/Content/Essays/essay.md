As Margaret Mead once said,  "Two roads diverged in a wood." And I, this is my thesis sentence. When I think about concepts, this quote really resonates with me. What does it mean to verb in this world? Follow through with 3 ideas in the middle paragraphs.

This is paragraph 1. Here I elucidate a well-traveled idea about truth and beauty (beauty and truth). Art was then, in you, but it is also now, in me. Now I'll transition.

Paragraph 2 follows naturally. Your company's mission really resonates with Albert Schweizer, and I'd welcome the chance to contribute to his team. His team of sled dogs except one went off on his own and became a wolf.

I didn't remember to transition before so I'll do it now. This is paragraph 3. Probably I can think of 3 ideas, but if not, I'll accept a B. As Eleanor Roosevelt famously said: "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their sertraline-induced dreams."

In concussion, therefore. Structure, prose, and an outline that matches. And as Confucius aways said, "Give peace a chance."
