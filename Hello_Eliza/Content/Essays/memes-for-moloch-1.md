The Go button is a lie.

It promises completion. Submit, send, execute. The word itself is movement—*go*—as if staying were not also a choice. As if the interface cared whether you were ready.

## The Tyranny of the Verb

Every button is an imperative. *Go. Submit. Send. Buy Now.* The interface speaks only in commands, and we've trained ourselves to obey. But imperative verbs are not neutral. They carry assumptions:

- That you know what you want
- That you've gathered enough information
- That speed is a virtue
- That hesitation is waste

The old terminals didn't have Go buttons. They had cursors. Blinking, patient, asking nothing. You typed when you were ready. The machine waited.

## What Zork Knew

Text adventures understood something we've forgotten: *input is thinking*. When you type "examine lamp" in Zork, you're not just issuing a command—you're forming a hypothesis about the world. The friction of typing is part of the cognition.

The Go button removes this friction. And in doing so, it removes the pause where thought happens.

> The cursor blinks. It does not judge your hesitation.

## Counter-Proposal

What if interfaces asked instead of commanded? What if the button said "When you're ready" instead of "Go"? What if it blinked, like a cursor, patient and present?

The machine can wait. It always could.
