Why do I grown my own very tiny carrots? I could buy them at the store. I could buy them from a local farmer. 

It is for the same reason I make my bed in the morning. It is me taming the storm one small action at a time with my own two hands. I did not used to make my bed. This is not because I am a type B person who became a type A person. This is because at that time, I did not know there was a storm.

When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I made a castle in the sky to hide from cruelty and Jordan Peterson.

I grow carrots because I eat carrots.
