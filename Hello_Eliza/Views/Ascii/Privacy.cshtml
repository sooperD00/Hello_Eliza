        This application collects zero data. Zilch. Nada. We don't even know you're here.

        No cookies (except the ones ASP.NET Core insists on for anti-forgery tokens—blame Microsoft, not me).
        No tracking. No analytics. No ad networks. No selling your ASCII art preferences to Tessier-Ashpool.
