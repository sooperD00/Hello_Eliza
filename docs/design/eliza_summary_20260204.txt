AI Overview
ELIZA, developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT between 1964 and 1966, is a pioneering natural language processing program designed to simulate conversation, famously emulating a Rogerian psychotherapist. Its "state machine" approach is not a formal, complex, multi-state diagram, but rather a functional, rule-based text transformation system driven by keyword detection.

Core Mechanisms of ELIZA
ELIZA operates by parsing user input, identifying keywords, and transforming those inputs into responses using a "script".

Keyword Identification (The Trigger): The program scans user input for predefined keywords, which are ranked by importance.
Decomposition Rules (The Input Matcher): Once a keyword is found, ELIZA uses "decomposition rules" (or templates) to break down the sentence into parts. The symbol 0 is used to represent an indefinite number of words, allowing for flexible matching.
Reassembly Rules (The Output Generator): These rules are associated with specific decomposition rules to generate a response, often by rearranging the input and replacing keywords (e.g., transforming "you" to "I").
"Script" as Data: ELIZA's conversational ability is contained in a "script" (like "DOCTOR"), which is treated as data, not part of the program's core logic. This allowed ELIZA to operate in different languages (German, Welsh).
Contextual Memory: While simple, ELIZA could maintain a form of memory by storing previously used transformation rules to avoid repeating the same responses.
Handling No Keywords: If no keywords are found, ELIZA defaults to a content-free remark (e.g., "Please continue").

Example of the Process
User Input: "It seems that you hate me".
Keyword: "you" or "me".
Decomposition: (0 YOU 0 ME).
Reassembly: (WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I 3 YOU) (where '3' represents the 3rd part of the input, e.g., 'hate').
Output: "What makes you think I hate you".

Key Takeaways
Illusion of Understanding: ELIZA is often considered the first chatbot, but it was designed to show that natural language conversation was possible without real understanding, just pattern matching.
The "ELIZA Effect": The program is famously known for creating an "illusion of understanding," where users would project human-like empathy onto a simple script.
Implementation: Originally written in MAD-SLIP for the IBM 7094.
